    "# Steps to Make an ER Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Identify Entity Sets**\n",
    "- Determine the primary entities involved in the system. For the banking system example, entities include Branch, Customer, Employee, Account (with Saving and Current as subtypes), Loan, and Payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Identify Attributes and Their Types**\n",
    "- Specify attributes for each entity and classify them based on their types (e.g., derived, composite, single-valued, multivalued).\n",
    "- Examples include:\n",
    "  - **Branch:** Name, City, Assets, Liabilities.\n",
    "  - **Customer:** ID, Name, DOB (from which Age is derived), Address (composite), Contact Number (multivalued).\n",
    "  - **Employee:** ID, Name, Years of Service (derived), Contact Number, Date of Joining (single-valued), Dependents' Names (multivalued).\n",
    "  - **Accounts (Saving and Current):** Interest Rate, Daily Withdrawal Limit (for Saving); Overdraft Amount (for Current).\n",
    "  - **Loan:** Number, Amount.\n",
    "  - **Payment:** (Weak Entity) Payment Number, Date, Amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Identify Relationships and Constraints**\n",
    "- Map out the relationships between entities and define constraints such as mapping cardinality and participation (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-one).\n",
    "- Examples include:\n",
    "  - Customers can borrow multiple loans (M:N relationship).\n",
    "  - Loans originated by a branch (N:1 relationship).\n",
    "  - Loan payments associated with loans (1:N relationship).\n",
    "  - Customers associated with bankers (Employees) and the accounts they hold (M:N relationships for both).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Banking System ER Diagram Example\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entity Sets:** Branch, Customer, Employee, Saving Account, Current Account, Loan, Payment.\n",
    "- **Attributes:**\n",
    "  - Each entity is detailed with specific attributes like Branch Name, Customer ID, Employee Service Years, Account Numbers, and Loan Amounts.\n",
    "- **Relationships & Constraints:**\n",
    "  - The relationships outlined show how customers interact with loans and accounts, how employees are associated with customers and branches, and how loans are managed within the banking system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generalization:** The concept of generalizing entities like Saving Account and Current Account into a generalized \"Account\" entity to capture common attributes like account number and balance.\n",
    "- **Weak Entity:** Payment is identified as a weak entity since its existence depends on the Loan entity.\n",
    "- **Special Attributes:** The diagram notes various attribute types, including derived (e.g., age from DOB), composite (e.g., address), and multivalued (e.g., contact numbers, dependent names).\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: The double lines seen in the above picture represents total participation which happens only when every entity in E participates in at least one relationship in R. In simple words, Total participation is where an entity must participate in a relationship to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating an ER diagram involves systematically identifying and organizing the components of the system you're modeling. This includes entities, their attributes, the relationships among these entities, and any specific constraints on those relationships. The banking system example showcases a complex scenario where multiple entity types interact, demonstrating the utility of ER diagrams in capturing the essence of such systems for database design and implementation."
